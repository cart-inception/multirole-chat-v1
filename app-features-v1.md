Feature Sheet: Gemini API Web ApplicationThis document outlines the proposed features and technical considerations for developing a web application that leverages the Google Gemini API, focusing on JavaScript/TypeScript, and designed for initial deployment on a VPS with support for multiple concurrent users and persistent data.1. Core FeaturesUser Input Interface:A clean, simple text input area for users to type their prompts/questions.A "Send" or "Submit" button to send the prompt to the backend.Clear visual indication when the application is processing a request.Gemini API Integration:Backend service to securely handle API calls to the Google Gemini API.Pass user prompts to the API.Receive responses from the API.Response Display:Display the AI's response in a clear, readable format within the chat interface.Distinguish visually between user prompts and AI responses (e.g., different background colors, alignment).Conversation History (Session & Persistent):Display the current session's conversation history chronologically.Maintain conversation context for follow-up questions within a single session.Save conversation history across sessions for logged-in users.Provide users the ability to view their past conversations.User Authentication & Accounts:Allow users to sign up and log in securely.Store and manage user account information.Associate conversation history with specific user accounts.2. Advanced Features Enhanced Conversation Management:Ability for users to search and potentially delete past conversations.More sophisticated methods for managing conversation context passed to the Gemini API (e.g., summarizing previous turns, selecting relevant history).Customization & Settings:Allow users to potentially adjust API parameters (e.g., creativity/temperature, response length limits - if supported by the specific Gemini model/API).UI theme customization (light/dark mode).Response Formatting:Render Markdown or other formatting (like code blocks with syntax highlighting) present in the API response.Error Handling & Feedback:More granular user feedback for different types of API errors, network issues, etc.Option to retry failed requests.Streaming Responses:Display the AI's response token by token as it's generated for a more interactive feel.3. Technical Stack Considerations (JavaScript/TypeScript Focus)Frontend:Language: JavaScript / TypeScriptFramework/Library: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS/JS/TS.Styling: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, or custom CSS.Backend:Language/Framework: Node.js (Express, NestJS, etc.) is a strong choice for a full-stack JS/TS approach.API Client: Official Google AI SDK for Node.js/JS/TS.Database:Type: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL recommended for relational user/history data) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Firestore).Hosting: To be run on the same VPS as the application backend. Ensure appropriate database server software is installed and configured on the VPS.API Key Management: Secure storage and handling of Google Gemini API keys (e.g., environment variables on the VPS, configuration files with restricted permissions).Concurrency Management: Backend design should handle state and requests for multiple simultaneous users effectively (e.g., using appropriate session management, asynchronous processing).4. UI/UX GoalsIntuitive Interface: Simple, clean, and easy for multiple users to interact with simultaneously.Responsiveness: Ensure the application works well on various screen sizes.Performance: Fast loading times and quick response rendering, even with database interactions.Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility best practices (WCAG).5. Deployment & ScalabilityInitial Hosting: Virtual Private Server (VPS). Requires manual setup and maintenance of the OS, web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache), Node.js runtime, database, and application deployment process (e.g., using PM2 or similar process manager).Scalability: The initial design should handle up to 8 concurrent users efficiently on a moderately specified VPS. Future scaling might involve upgrading the VPS, optimizing database queries, or migrating to cloud-based auto-scaling solutions (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Vercel, Netlify).
